## Features

### Experimental review foundation

`codediff.nvim` now includes an experimental built-in `:CodeReview` command so review workflow code can be consolidated into this repo over time.

Current built-ins:
- `:CodeReview` / `:CodeReview open` — open a review session on the current working tree
- `:CodeReview commits REV [REV2]` — open a review session for a revision or revision range
- `:CodeReview export` — export stored review comments to the clipboard
- `:CodeReview preview` — preview exported markdown
- `:CodeReview clear` — clear stored review comments

This is intentionally minimal for now: comment storage/export now lives in `lua/codediff/review/`, while interactive comment UI and annotations still need to be folded in.


- **Two-tier highlighting system**:
  - Light backgrounds for entire modified lines (green for insertions, red for deletions)
  - Deep/dark character-level highlights showing exact changes within lines
- **Side-by-side diff view** in a new tab with synchronized scrolling
- **Inline (unified) diff view** — single-window layout with deleted lines as virtual overlays, with treesitter syntax highlighting
- **Toggle layout** — switch between side-by-side and inline layout at runtime with `t`
- **Git integration**: Compare between any git revision (HEAD, commits, branches, tags)
- **Pierre-based diff engine** — the same [@pierre/diffs](https://github.com/pierredotco/diffs) core that powers [Hunk](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk), running in a long-lived Bun sidecar process
- **Async git operations** - non-blocking file retrieval from git
- **Moved code detection** — identifies blocks of code that moved within a file, with visual indicators (highlights, signs, annotations) matching VSCode's experimental `showMoves` feature (opt-in)
- **Skeleton view** — `s` cycles off → skeleton → seams-only. Skeleton folds unchanged function bodies via treesitter, so a diff reads as signatures + changed code; seams-only additionally folds changed bodies, leaving just signature/declaration-level changes visible for a quick first scan. Works in both layouts (side-by-side mirrors folds across panes to preserve alignment) and stays on across file switches until toggled off

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Neovim >= 0.10
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)
- Git (for git diff features)

**No compiler or dependency installation required.** The Bun engine and its runtime dependencies ship as a single JavaScript bundle.

### Using lazy.nvim

**Minimal installation:**
```lua
{
  "esmuellert/codediff.nvim",
  cmd = "CodeDiff",
}
```

> **Note:** The plugin automatically adapts to your colorscheme's background (dark/light). It uses `DiffAdd` and `DiffDelete` for line-level diffs, and auto-adjusts brightness for character-level highlights (1.4x brighter for dark themes, 0.92x darker for light themes). See [Highlight Groups](#highlight-groups) for customization.

**With custom configuration:**
```lua
{
  "esmuellert/codediff.nvim",
  cmd = "CodeDiff",
  opts = {
    -- Highlight configuration
    highlights = {
      -- Line-level: accepts highlight group names or hex colors (e.g., "#2ea043")
      line_insert = "DiffAdd",      -- Line-level insertions
      line_delete = "DiffDelete",   -- Line-level deletions

      -- Character-level: accepts highlight group names or hex colors
      -- If specified, these override char_brightness calculation
      char_insert = nil,            -- Character-level insertions (nil = auto-derive)
      char_delete = nil,            -- Character-level deletions (nil = auto-derive)

      -- Brightness multiplier (only used when char_insert/char_delete are nil)
      -- nil = auto-detect based on background (1.4 for dark, 0.92 for light)
      char_brightness = nil,        -- Auto-adjust based on your colorscheme

      -- Conflict sign highlights (for merge conflict views)
      -- Accepts highlight group names or hex colors (e.g., "#f0883e")
      -- nil = use default fallback chain
      conflict_sign = nil,          -- Unresolved: DiagnosticSignWarn -> #f0883e
      conflict_sign_resolved = nil, -- Resolved: Comment -> #6e7681
      conflict_sign_accepted = nil, -- Accepted: GitSignsAdd -> DiagnosticSignOk -> #3fb950
      conflict_sign_rejected = nil, -- Rejected: GitSignsDelete -> DiagnosticSignError -> #f85149

The bundled engine runs directly from the plugin checkout. No build step is needed.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually without a plugin manager:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/esmuellert/codediff.nvim ~/.local/share/nvim/codediff.nvim
```

2. **Add to your Neovim runtime path in `init.lua`:**
```lua
vim.opt.rtp:append("~/.local/share/nvim/codediff.nvim")
```

## Usage

The `:CodeDiff` command supports multiple modes:

### File Explorer Mode

Open an interactive file explorer showing changed files:

```vim
" Show git status in explorer (default)
:CodeDiff

" Show changes for specific revision in explorer
:CodeDiff HEAD~5

" Compare against a branch
:CodeDiff main

" Compare against a specific commit
:CodeDiff abc123

" Compare two revisions (e.g. HEAD vs main)
:CodeDiff main HEAD

" Override layout for this invocation (works with all subcommands)
:CodeDiff --inline
:CodeDiff main --side-by-side
```

#### PR-like Diff (Merge-base)

Show only changes introduced since branching from a base branch—exactly like a Pull Request:

```vim
" Compare merge-base(main, HEAD) vs working tree
" Shows only YOUR changes since you branched from main
:CodeDiff main...

" Compare merge-base(main, HEAD) vs HEAD (committed changes only)
:CodeDiff main...HEAD

" Compare merge-base between two branches
:CodeDiff develop...feature/new-ui
```

This uses `git merge-base` semantics (equivalent to `git diff main...HEAD`), showing only the changes introduced on your branch, not changes that happened on the base branch since you branched.

### Git Diff Mode

Compare the current buffer with a git revision:

```vim
" Compare with last commit
:CodeDiff file HEAD

" Compare with previous commit
:CodeDiff file HEAD~1

" Compare with specific commit
:CodeDiff file abc123

" Compare with branch
:CodeDiff file main

" Compare with tag
:CodeDiff file v1.0.0

" Compare two revisions for current file
:CodeDiff file main HEAD

" PR-like diff: compare merge-base(main, HEAD) vs working tree
:CodeDiff file main...
```

**Requirements:**
- Current buffer must be saved to a file
- File must be in a git repository
- Git revision must exist

**Behavior:**
- Left buffer: Git version (at specified revision) - readonly
- Right buffer: Current buffer content - readonly
- Opens in a new tab automatically
- Async operation - won't block Neovim

### File Comparison Mode

Compare two arbitrary files side-by-side:

```vim
:CodeDiff file file_a.txt file_b.txt
```

### Directory Comparison Mode

Compare two directories without git:

```vim
" Auto-detect directories
:CodeDiff ~/project-v1 ~/project-v2

" Explicit dir subcommand
:CodeDiff dir /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

Shows files as Added (A), Deleted (D), or Modified (M) using file size plus byte-level content comparison. Select a file to view its diff.

### File History Mode

Review commits on a per-commit basis:

```vim
" Show last 50 commits
:CodeDiff history

" Show last N commits
:CodeDiff history HEAD~10

" Show commits in a range (great for PR review)
:CodeDiff history origin/main..HEAD

" Show commits for current file only
:CodeDiff history HEAD~20 %

" Show commits for a specific file
:CodeDiff history HEAD~10 path/to/file.lua

" Show commits in chronological order (oldest first)
:CodeDiff history --reverse
:CodeDiff history HEAD~10 --reverse
:CodeDiff history origin/main..HEAD -r
:CodeDiff history HEAD~20 % --reverse

" Compare each commit against the current working tree
:CodeDiff history --base WORKING

" Compare each commit against HEAD
:CodeDiff history --base HEAD

" Line-range history: show only commits that changed the selected lines
:'<,'>CodeDiff history
:'<,'>CodeDiff history HEAD~10
:'<,'>CodeDiff history --reverse
```

The history panel shows a list of commits. Each commit can be expanded to show its changed files. Select a file to view the diff between the commit and its parent (`commit^` vs `commit`).

**Options:**
- `--reverse` or `-r`: Show commits in chronological order (oldest first) instead of reverse chronological. Useful for following development story from beginning to end, or reviewing PR changes in the order they were made.
- `--base` or `-b`: Compare each commit against a fixed revision instead of its parent. Accepts any git revision (`HEAD`, branch name, commit hash) or `WORKING` for the current working tree.
- `--inline` / `--side-by-side`: Override the diff layout for this invocation. These flags work with all `:CodeDiff` subcommands.

**Visual selection:** When called with a visual range (`:'<,'>CodeDiff history`), only commits that modified the selected lines are shown. This uses `git log -L` under the hood and is useful for tracing the evolution of a specific function or block in a large file.

**History Keymaps:**
- `i` - Toggle between list and tree view for files under commits

### Git Merge Tool

Use CodeDiff as your git merge tool for resolving conflicts:

```bash
git config --global merge.tool codediff
git config --global mergetool.codediff.cmd 'nvim "$MERGED" -c "CodeDiff merge \"$MERGED\""'
```

### Git Diff Tool

Use CodeDiff as your git diff tool for viewing changes:

```bash
git config --global diff.tool codediff
git config --global difftool.codediff.cmd 'nvim "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" +"CodeDiff file $LOCAL $REMOTE"'
```

Then use `git difftool` to view diffs:

```bash
git difftool                      # View all uncommitted changes
git difftool HEAD~2 HEAD          # Compare two commits
git difftool main feature-branch  # Compare branches
git difftool -y                   # Skip confirmation prompts
```

### Lua API

```lua
-- Primary user API - setup configuration
require("codediff").setup({
  highlights = {
    line_insert = "DiffAdd",
    line_delete = "DiffDelete",
    char_brightness = 1.4,
  },
})

-- Advanced usage - direct access to internal modules
local diff = require("codediff.diff")
local render = require("codediff.ui")
local git = require("codediff.git")

-- Example 1: Compute diff between two sets of lines
local lines_a = {"line 1", "line 2"}
local lines_b = {"line 1", "modified line 2"}
local lines_diff = diff.compute_diff(lines_a, lines_b)

-- Example 2: Get file content from git (async)
git.get_file_content("HEAD~1", "/path/to/repo", "relative/path.lua", function(err, lines)
  if err then
    vim.notify(err, vim.log.levels.ERROR)
    return
  end
  -- Use lines...
end)

-- Example 3: Get git root for a file (async)
git.get_git_root("/path/to/file.lua", function(err, git_root)
  if not err then
    -- File is in a git repository
  end
end)
```

### User Autocmd Events

CodeDiff emits `User` autocmd events at key lifecycle points, allowing you to customize behavior without config flags:

| Event | When | Data |
|-------|------|------|
| `CodeDiffOpen` | After diff view is fully ready | `tabpage`, `mode` |
| `CodeDiffClose` | Before cleanup starts | `tabpage`, `mode` |
| `CodeDiffFileSelect` | When a file is selected in explorer | `tabpage`, `path`, `status` |

`mode` is one of `"explorer"`, `"standalone"`, or `"history"`.

<details>
<summary>Example: Disable cursorline in diff windows</summary>

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
  pattern = "CodeDiffOpen",
  callback = function()
    for _, win in ipairs(vim.api.nvim_tabpage_list_wins(0)) do
      vim.wo[win].cursorline = false
    end
  end,
})
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example: Hide tabline while CodeDiff is open</summary>

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
  pattern = "CodeDiffOpen",
  callback = function()
    vim.g.codediff_saved_showtabline = vim.o.showtabline
    vim.o.showtabline = 0
  end,
})
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
  pattern = "CodeDiffClose",
  callback = function()
    if vim.g.codediff_saved_showtabline then
      vim.o.showtabline = vim.g.codediff_saved_showtabline
      vim.g.codediff_saved_showtabline = nil
    end
  end,
})
```

</details>
```

## Architecture

### Components

- **Diff Engine** (`engine/`): Bun/TypeScript sidecar built on [@pierre/diffs](https://github.com/pierredotco/diffs)
  - Hunk/Pierre diff core with character-level refinement for highlighting
  - Block-level moved-code detection
  - Long-lived process speaking newline-delimited JSON over stdio

- **Lua Engine Client** (`lua/codediff/core/diff.lua`): Bridge between the engine and Lua
  - Spawns one engine per Neovim instance and keeps it alive
  - Returns the same `LinesDiff` structure (changes, inner char ranges, moves) the renderer has always consumed

- **Render Module** (`lua/codediff/ui/`): Neovim buffer rendering
  - VSCode-style highlight groups
  - Virtual line insertion for alignment
  - Side-by-side window management
  - Git status explorer

### Syntax Highlighting

The plugin handles syntax highlighting differently based on buffer type:

**Working files (editable):**
- Behaves like normal buffers with standard highlighting
- Inlay hints disabled by default (incompatible with diff highlights)
- All LSP features available

**Git history files (read-only):**
- Virtual buffers stored in memory, discarded when tab closes
- TreeSitter highlighting applied automatically (if installed)
- LSP not attached (most features meaningless for historical files)
- Semantic token highlighting fetched via LSP request when available

### Highlight Groups

The plugin defines highlight groups matching VSCode's diff colors:

- `CodeDiffLineInsert` - Light green background for inserted lines
- `CodeDiffLineDelete` - Light red background for deleted lines
- `CodeDiffCharInsert` - Deep/dark green for inserted characters
- `CodeDiffCharDelete` - Deep/dark red for deleted characters
- `CodeDiffFiller` - Gray foreground for filler line slashes (`╱╱╱`)
- `CodeDiffLineMove` - Background for moved code lines (derived from DiffChange)
- `CodeDiffMoveTo` - Sign column and annotation color for move indicators

</details>

**Default behavior:**
- Uses your colorscheme's `DiffAdd` and `DiffDelete` for line-level highlights
- Character-level highlights are auto-adjusted based on `vim.o.background`:
  - **Dark themes** (`background = "dark"`): Brightness multiplied by `1.4` (40% brighter)
  - **Light themes** (`background = "light"`): Brightness multiplied by `0.92` (8% darker)
- This auto-detection works out-of-box for most colorschemes
- You can override with explicit `char_brightness` value if needed

**Customization examples:**

```lua
-- Use hex colors directly
highlights = {
  line_insert = "#1d3042",
  line_delete = "#351d2b",
  char_brightness = 1.5,  -- Override auto-detection with explicit value
}

-- Override character colors explicitly
highlights = {
  line_insert = "DiffAdd",
  line_delete = "DiffDelete",
  char_insert = "#3fb950",
  char_delete = "#ff7b72",
}

-- Mix highlight groups and hex colors
highlights = {
  line_insert = "String",
  char_delete = "#ff0000",
}
```

## Development

### Building

```bash
just build             # install dev dependencies and rebuild engine/dist/main.js
```

### Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
just test              # Run all tests (engine + Lua integration)
```

Run specific test suites:
```bash
just test-engine       # Engine (bun) unit tests only
just test-lua          # Lua integration tests only
```

For more details on the test structure, see [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md).

## Roadmap

### Current Status: Complete ✅

- [x] Pierre-based diff computation in a Bun sidecar (same diff core as Hunk)
- [x] Two-tier highlighting (line + character level)
- [x] Side-by-side view with synchronized scrolling
- [x] Git integration (async operations, status explorer, revision comparison)
- [x] Auto-refresh on buffer changes (live diff updates)
- [x] Syntax highlighting preservation (LSP semantic tokens + TreeSitter)
- [x] Read-only buffers with virtual filler lines for alignment
- [x] Flexible highlight configuration (colorscheme-aware)
- [x] Integration tests (engine + Lua with plenary.nvim)
- [x] File history mode (per-commit review, similar to DiffviewFileHistory)

### Future Enhancements

- [x] Inline diff mode (single buffer view)
- [x] Moved code detection (VSCode parity)
- [ ] Fold support for large diffs
